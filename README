NAME
    RT::Extension::ArticleTemplates - Turns Articles into dynamic templates

DESCRIPTION
    When this extension is installed, RT parses the content of Articles as a
    template, using the Text::Template module; this can be used to make your
    Articles dynamic. Text::Template is the same module that RT's Templates
    use as well.

VERY IMPORTANT
    It's a SECURITY RISK to install this extension on systems where articles
    can be changed by not trusted users.

    if your articles contain text that currently looks like a template, it
    will begin being parsed as Text::Template code after this extension is
    installed -- even if it is not a valid template.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::ArticleTemplates');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::ArticleTemplates));

        or add RT::Extension::ArticleTemplates to your existing @Plugins
        line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
  ArticleTemplatesWithRequestArgs
    Enabling this option passes in the Mason request arguments to your
    article templates as the hashref $request_args.

    Warning: Request args are user-controlled direct input, so all the
    normal cautions of using them apply. Never trust user input.

    Disabled by default.

METHODS
    The following methods from RT::Article are redefined:

  ParseTemplate $CONTENT, %TEMPLATE_ARGS
    Parses $CONTENT string as a template (Text::Template). $Article and
    other arguments from %TEMPLATE_ARGS are available in code of the
    template as perl variables.
