NAME
    RT::Extension::ArticleTemplates - turns articles into dynamic templates

DESCRIPTION
    When this extension is installed RTFM parses content of articles as a
    template using Text::Template module. Using this extension you can make
    your articles dynamic. Text::Template module is used to parse RT's
    Templates as well and its syntax is pretty simple - you can consult RT
    docs/wiki or module's documentation.

VERY IMPORTANT
    It's a SECURITY RISK to install this extension on systems where articles
    can be changed by not trusted users. You're warned!

    Your articles may contain some text that looks like a template and will
    be parsed after installation when it's actually is not valid template.

INSTALLATION
    This extension requires RT 4.0.0 or higher.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm

CONFIGURATION
  ArticleTemplatesWithRequestArgs
    Enabling this option passes in the Mason request arguments to your
